# Party Shaker
My own project, app which allows user to find cocktails by indegridient. 

**Work still in progress**

Before I started coding, I designed UI. You can check it by clicking [HERE.](https://xd.adobe.com/view/bc591fc9-74f9-429d-7303-61987e1ae289-ca68/?fullscreen)

Firstly, I will make every function work properly, after that I will start to refactor code to look better. I decided to create app this way so at this moment code may look not perfect. This is due to the fact that refactoring will improve my skills.

At this moment in this project I'm using Volley, Picasso and Butterknife.
